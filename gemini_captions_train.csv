220,710,"Two bright flux centroids are visible, one bottom-left and one top-right of the image center. They are connected by a diffuse, elongated structure that spans between them. No distinct, unassociated sources are observed."
221,711,"Two bright flux centroids are observed, one above and one below the image center. Diffuse emission forms a narrow, elongated structure, appearing as two lobes or jets originating from the center and extending outwards, connecting the centroids. No other sources are apparent."
222,712,"The image displays two bright flux centroids in the central region, one left-center and a slightly dimmer one right-center. Diffuse, extended emission connects these centroids, forming an elongated structure predominantly along the horizontal axis. This emission originates from the centroids and fades outward. No other distinct sources are visible."
223,713,"A bright, diffuse flux centroid is left-of-center. A second, brighter centroid is right-of-center, featuring a narrow, faint extension originating from it and directed towards the left centroid. Several extremely faint, unassociated point sources are sparsely distributed across the field."
224,714,"Two bright flux centroids are in the upper-center and lower-center. The lower-center centroid features a diffuse lobe-like extension originating from its core, extending lower-left. A faint, diffuse connection links these two main sources. A weak, unassociated point source is visible bottom-right."
225,715,"The image displays an elongated, diffuse flux structure in the center, appearing to originate centrally and extend horizontally. A bright, compact flux centroid is prominent in the upper right, seemingly unassociated with the central emission. No distinct jets or symmetrical lobes are evident from the central structure."
226,716,"Two bright, slightly extended flux centroids appear near the image center. The western centroid is somewhat diffuse, while the eastern one is more compact. No clear lobes or jets emanate from these central sources. Several very faint, point-like sources are distributed across the field, unassociated with the main objects."
227,717,"Two compact, bright flux centroids are observed near the image center, slightly offset left and right. No distinct lobes or jets are evident originating from or ending at these centroids. No other sources are detected within the field of view."
228,718,"A bright, complex source is centered, consisting of two distinct flux centroids vertically aligned. The brighter centroid is slightly below center. These are connected by diffuse emission, forming an elongated, lobular structure extending vertically from a central region. No collimated jets or unassociated sources are evident."
229,719,"Two compact, bright flux centroids are centrally located, one slightly upper-left and the other lower-right. No extended lobes or jets are resolved originating from these sources. There are no other discernible sources in the image."
230,720,"A single, bright, diffuse centroid of flux is prominent near the image center, appearing slightly elongated horizontally. No distinct radio lobes, jets, or other isolated sources are observed within the field of view."
231,721,"The image features two bright, extended flux centroids centrally located, flanking a compact central source. Fainter, elongated emission forms outward-extending jets originating from the central source, terminating at these bright centroids. Several very faint, unresolved point sources are present in the background."
232,722,"Two bright flux centroids dominate the lower-middle. The left centroid shows diffuse vertical emission, forming a compact lobe. The right centroid displays similar vertical diffuse emission, also a compact lobe. A faint, compact source is visible in the bottom-right, unassociated with the main centroids. No distinct jets are apparent."
233,723,"The image shows two bright, distinct flux centroids near the center, oriented top-left to bottom-right. They are connected by fainter emission, forming an elongated, double-lobed structure. These centroids represent the brightest parts of the lobes, originating from an unresolved region between them and extending outwards. No distinct jets are visible. No other distinct sources are present."
234,724,"The image displays two bright, resolved flux centroids in the left-center, forming a compact double source. A less luminous, discrete centroid is located on the far right. No extended lobes or collimated jets are discernible originating from or associated with these point-like features."
235,725,"Two compact, bright flux centroids are visible near the image center, forming a close pair. No associated lobes or jets originate from these sources. No other sources are detected elsewhere in the field."
236,726,"Two bright flux centroids are prominent, located just left and right of the image center. Faint, diffuse emission extends between these centroids, appearing to originate from a central point and terminating at the centroids. No other distinct sources are present."
237,727,"Two bright, compact flux centroids are centrally located and horizontally separated. No clear lobes or jets are visibly associated with these sources. No other distinct sources are detected in the field of view."
238,728,"A bright central flux centroid is observed with two prominent, extended lobes symmetrically extending left and right, appearing to originate from the center. Fainter, unassociated point-like sources are also scattered across the field."
